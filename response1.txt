But I _chose_ not to do that. ", "email": "hiddicop@gmail.com", "mechanics": "The mouse not being able to move on ice without something to push is an interesting mechanics that I haven't seen before. That a moving ice block hitting another simply transferred it's movement to the next is also a neat mechanic that gave rise to some really nice puzzles.\n\nAt some points early on in the game it thought it was somewhat unclear what would happen when I made a specific move, e.g. if I step onto ice and run into a box standing on the ice, I was unsure if the box would move, and if I would end up right before the box or replace it, and would have to remind myself by trying. Similarly, realizing that boxes can be pushed from the opposite side of an ice block was unexepected, despite being entirely consistent with the overall mechanics.\n\nThis means a part of what made the puzzle difficult to solve was simply remembering the details of the mechanics, which is not ideal. However, I don't think this is a significant problem, it didn't take too long until it felt natural and fairly intuitive, and I could easily just reason about the puzzle, without having to try things out.\n\nThe fact that the ice block slides over the hole seems somewhat contrived and doesn't make a lot of sense to me, especially as boxes always fall into the whole, even if the ice block has passed previously passed over it, supposedly leaving a trail of ice on the ground around it (which is missing visually at the moment). This mechanic obviously fills a purpose from the perspective of puzzle design, so I am not suggesting you must change this, but I'd try to make it visually more clear and reasonable. For example, making the hole slightly smaller, along with the boxes, so that the ice block obviously doesn't fit, and thus slides over on the sides of the hole (and having a melting animation when it actually stops on the hole, to justify why it suddendly fits).\n\nThe mechanics felt inconsistent in some ways. The fact that boxes do not transfer their momentum to ice blocks, and not even to each other like ice blocks do, seems abritrary and unintuitive to me, and becomes an extra rule to remember and occassionally forget, once again taking focus away from the actual puzzle solving to just remembering all aspects and details of the mechanics.\n\nNot sure how big an issue this is. I know that I am a purist in these regards, but I suspect many players will feel fine just exploring the mechanics and learning how the various different interactions work.", "pacing": "Good pacing overall. You learned new things at an appropriate pace, it did not feel particularly repetetive, and the difficultly remained roughly proportional to my skill level, so that almost each puzzle required some actual thinking.", "general": "Really nice puzzle design that nicely explores the consequenses of the core mechanics.\n\nA thing I liked in particular is that on several occassions I noticed neat little maneuvers while solving a puzzle, that were not useful in that particular puzzle. But pretty much all om them showed up later on. This was very satisfying, getting to think \"Aha! Now I can actually use that neat trick I realized earlier!\".\n\nAlso, a very specific thing I enjoyed was the billiard ball sound of ice blocks colliding. Excellent sound design.\n\nOne think I didn't like was the movement, it felt way too jerky and discrete, a lot more like moving a rock than walking, and the sound effect did not help in this respect. I think making the movement smoother would give a much more pleasing player experience, and match the overall mood of the game. Possibly, the mouse not being animated contributes to this, I am not sure.", "bugs": "After closing the game at the final level (Back home), with every level solved, I was stuck there when relaunching the game, with no paths to previous levels, so I had to reset the progress to replay the puzzles.\n\nIf you fall into the hole you can keep moving around, and hear the walking sound.", "levels": [{"difficulty": 0, "interest": 0, "notes": ""}, {"difficulty": "1", "interest": "2", "notes": ""}, {"difficulty": "2", "interest": "3", "notes": "I got stuck for probably a minute in the beginning, wondering if something was wrong, because there was obviously nothing I could do.
